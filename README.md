# iTunes-Backup-Decryption
Python tools for decrypting iOS backups.
Python command line script for parsing iOS backups. Uses code from Stack Exchange user andrewdotn primarily, and the aes_keywrap python functions from github user kurtbrose.
You must download both of these files, as the decryptor script utilizes functions from the aes_keywrap script.
